				<h1>Call for Proposals</h1>

				<p>The Pacific Northwest Scala Conference will be taking place this year in Portland, Oregon on October 19th &amp; 20th. We look forward to engaging with Scala users and those interested in learning more about Scala, from the Pacific Northwest and beyond. We will be hosting a two-day event with one single-track day of talks and a second day dedicated to open, self-organized working sessions, discussions, and focus groups. If you have a topic you’re passionate about, perhaps an area of interest in which you've become your company's or user-group's resident expert, or a new approach you'd like to share, we encourage you to submit a proposal for a talk.</p>

				<p>Areas of interest that talks might cover include (but are certainly not limited to):
					<ul>
						<li>Case studies &amp; experience reports</li>
						<li>Interesting patterns &amp; designs</li>
						<li>Reliability &amp; fault-tolerance</li>
						<li>Concurrency &amp; distributed systems</li>
						<li>Data management &amp; large-scale data</li>
						<li>Tools &amp; techniques</li>
						<li>DSLs</li>
						<li>Functional programming</li>
						<li>Migrating to Scala from other languages</li>
						<li>Beginner focused topics</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>If you would like to give a talk at PNWScala 2013, please submit your information using <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/lockney.net/forms/d/1DlyGdv6DtXT4G-icF8k5u_T-XaEQqCshiTii2biPPDo/viewform">this form</a>. Talks should be 30 minutes in length and additional time will be provided for questions, so you don't need to account for that. Submissions are due September 7th and we will be selecting talks by September 21st at the latest. Please note that if your talk is accepted, you will be given free admittance (normally $100) to the conference. You may want to go ahead and register before we make selections (registration will be online very soon), in order to guarantee a spot. We’ll refund your fees if your talk was selected.</p>
